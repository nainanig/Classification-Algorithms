# Classification-Algorithms
•	Implemented three classification algorithms namely Naïve Bayes, Nearest Neighbor and Decision tree on given datasets containing a mix of continuous and categorical data. 
•	Implemented Random forests based on the implementation of decision tree.
•	Used 10-fold cross validation to evaluate performance of all methods on the provided two datasets in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F-1 measure.
